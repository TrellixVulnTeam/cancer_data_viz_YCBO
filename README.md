### PROJECT SUMMARY
DSCI 554 Final Project for City of Hope. 

City of Hope is a specialized hospital and research center in the greater Los Angeles area, serving many patients from far outside the local region. The hospital employs clinicians and researchers with expertise in many different types of cancers (and other diseases), and patients come to the hospital at various clinical stages; from diagnosis to palliative care. To aid in overseeing the flow of tens of thousands of patients that come in each year, we created a dashboard with clinical details of these patients. We hope that this dashboard helps aid in patient management and leads to clinical or population insights of cancer patients in Los Angeles.
